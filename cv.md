# AboutMe
-------
I'm 27 y.o. Graduated in 2019 from university with a degree in translation. But my desire of new knowledge lead me to programing. I wanna to become a front-end developer. 
I know that could be hard to switch branches, so I would make a big effort to achieve my aim.
As a beginner I've just started my RSSchool course my first project is the CV at https://github.com/KateBrance/rsschool-cv
Along the way my CV will be filled with my solved tasks.
